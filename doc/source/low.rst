RHEL-07-010490 - Unnecessary default system accounts must be removed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Default system accounts created at install time but never used by the system may inadvertently be configured for interactive logon. Vendor accounts and software may contain accounts that provide unauthorized access to the system. All accounts that are not used to support the system and application operation must be removed from the system.

Check
~~~~~

Verify unnecessary default system accounts have been removed.

Check the accounts that are on the system with the following command:

```
# more /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin
lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin
sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync
```

If unnecessary default accounts such as games or ftp exist in the “/etc/passwd” file, this is a finding.

RHEL-07-020300 - All Group Identifiers (GIDs) referenced in the /etc/passwd file must be defined in the /etc/group file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user is assigned the GID of a group not existing on the system, and a group with the GID is subsequently created, the user may have unintended rights to any files associated with the group.

Check
~~~~~

Verify all GIDs referenced in the “/etc/passwd” file are defined in the “/etc/group” file.

Check that all referenced GIDs exist with the following command:

```
# pwck -r
```

If GIDs referenced in “/etc/passwd” file are returned as not defined in “/etc/group” file, this is a finding.

RHEL-07-021240 - A separate file system must be used for user home directories (such as /home or an equivalent).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for non-privileged local interactive user home directories.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users (those with a UID greater than 1000) on the system with the following command:

```
#cut -d: -f 1,3,6,7 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{3}" | tr ":" "\t"

adamsj /home/adamsj /bin/bash
jacksonm /home/jacksonm /bin/bash
smithj /home/smithj /bin/bash
```

The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, /home) and users’ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged interactive users with the following command:

Note: The partition of /home is used in the example.

```
# grep /home /etc/fstab
UUID=333ada18    /home                   ext4    noatime,nobarrier,nodev  1 2
```

If a separate entry for the file system/partition that contains the non-privileged interactive users' home directories does not exist, or the file system/partition for the non-privileged interactive users is not /home, this is a finding.

RHEL-07-021260 - The system must use /var/log/audit for the system audit data path.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for the system audit data path.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the system audit data path with the following command:

```
#grep /var/log/audit /etc/fstab
UUID=3645951a    /var/log/audit          ext4    defaults                 1 2
```

If a separate entry for /var/log/audit does not exist, ask the System Administrator (SA) if the system audit logs are being written to a different file system/partition on the system, then grep for that file system/partition. 

If a separate file system/partition does not exist for the system audit data path, this is a finding.

RHEL-07-021600 - The file integrity tool must be configured to verify Access Control Lists (ACLs).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

ACLs can provide permissions beyond those permitted through the file mode and must be verified by file integrity tools.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify ACLs.

Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed on the system with the following command:

```
# yum list installed | grep aide
```

If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system. 

If there is no application installed to perform integrity checks, this is a finding.

Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the “aide.conf” file is under the “/etc directory”. 

Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

```
# find / -name aide.conf

Check the “aide.conf” file to determine if the “acl” rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists.
```

An example rule that includes the “acl” rule is below:

```
All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
/bin All            # apply the custom rule to the files in bin 
/sbin All          # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin 
```

If the “acl” rule is not being used on all selection lines in the “/etc/aide.conf” file, or acls are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.

RHEL-07-021610 - The file integrity tool must be configured to verify extended attributes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Extended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data and file metadata with security implications.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify extended attributes.

Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed on the system with the following command:

```
# yum list installed | grep aide
```

If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system.

If there is no application installed to perform integrity checks, this is a finding.

Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the “aide.conf” file is under the “/etc directory”.  

Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

```
# find / -name aide.conf
```

Check the “aide.conf” file to determine if the “xattrs” rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists.

An example rule that includes the “xattrs” rule follows:

```
All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
/bin All            # apply the custom rule to the files in bin 
/sbin All          # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin 
```

If the "xattrs" rule is not being used on all selection lines in the “/etc/aide.conf” file, or extended attributes are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.

RHEL-07-040010 - The operating system must limit the number of concurrent sessions to 10 for all accounts and/or account types.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks related to DoS attacks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based on mission needs and the operational environment for each system.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system limits the number of concurrent sessions to ten for all accounts and/or account types by issuing the following command:

```
# grep "maxlogins" /etc/security/limits.conf
* hard maxlogins 10
```

This can be set as a global domain (with the * wildcard) but may be set differently for multiple domains.

If the maxlogins item is missing or the value is not set to 10 or less for all domains that have the maxlogins item assigned, this is a finding.

RHEL-07-040300 - The system must display the date and time of the last successful account logon upon logon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Providing users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that users are provided with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

Check that “pam_lastlog” is used and not silent with the following command:

```
# grep pam_lastlog /etc/pam.d/postlogin

session     required      pam_lastlog.so showfailed silent
```

If “pam_lastlog” is missing from “/etc/pam.d/postlogin” file, or the silent option is present on the line check for the “PrintLastLog” keyword in the sshd daemon configuration file, this is a finding.

RHEL-07-040320 - For systems using DNS resolution, at least two name servers must be configured.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

Check
~~~~~

Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the following command:

```
# grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
hosts:   files dns
```

If the dns entry is missing from the host’s line in the “/etc/nsswitch.conf” file, the “/etc/resolv.conf” file must be empty.

Verify the “/etc/resolv.conf” file is empty with the following command:

```
# l s -al /etc/resolv.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root root        0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf
```

If local host authentication is being used and the “/etc/resolv.conf” file is not empty, this is a finding.

If the dns entry is found on the host’s line of the “/etc/nsswitch.conf” file, verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

Determine the name servers used by the system with the following command:

```
# grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.2
nameserver 192.168.1.3
```

If less than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding.
